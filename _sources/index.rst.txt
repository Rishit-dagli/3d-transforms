TensorFlow3d Transforms is a library to easily make 3D transformations and work with 3D data. This library originally started as a few functions here and there for my own work which I then turned into a library. 

TensorFlow3d Transforms is designed to integrate smoothly with deep learning methods for predicting and manipulating 3D data. For this reason, all operators in TensorFlow3d Transforms:

- Are implemented using TensorFlow tensors
- Can handle minibatches of hetereogenous data
- Can be differentiated
- Can utilize GPUs for acceleration

Much inspiration for this project is taken from `PyTorch3D <https://pytorch3d.org/>`
